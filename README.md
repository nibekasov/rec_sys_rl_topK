# topK-off-policy-correction
After trying out the pytorch implementation of [ncf](https://github.com/ustcljb/ncf-pytorch) model, which applies neural network to rs, I am eager to try on a different area. Given that the application of reinforment learning on recommerder systems becomes more and more popular recently, the paper [Top-K Off-Policy Correction for a REINFORCE Recommender System](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.02353.pdf) seems to be a very good and also very challenging project to start with.

There is some related example given [here](https://github.com/awarebayes/RecNN). However, The RecNN package is a super abstracted one. I'd like give a more comprehensive and more straightforward implementation using some public dataset.
